# Infinite canvas note-taking app
I was inspired by Rnote, but it lacked customizability so my goal is to create an altenative.

(It currently only implements the input code for the ugee s640 stylus using evdev)

## Current features:
- **Infinite Scrolling / Zooming Canvas**:  
  Allows you to pan (drag with stylus right-click or another button) and zoom (using mouse wheel) across an infinite plane.  
  The canvas renders repeating A4 pages in the background for orientation.

- **Pressure-Sensitive Drawing**:  
  Integrates stylus input (pressure, stylus button) to draw variable-thickness lines.  

- **Strokes with Smooth Catmull-Rom Spline algorithm**:  
  After finishing a stroke, the points are processed using a Catmull-Rom spline to produce a smoother line.  
  This creates a more refined drawing experience.

- **Save/Load Functionality**:  
  Press `Ctrl+S` to save your current strokes to a JSON file, and `Ctrl+O` to load them back.

- **Eraser Tool**:  
  Double-clicking the stylus button toggles between pen and eraser mode.  
  In eraser mode, touching the screen erases strokes near the stylus position.

## Controls
- **Draw (Pen Tool)**:  
  Apply pressure and move the stylus. The stroke thickness depends on pressure and current zoom.
- **Toggle Eraser**:  
  Double-click the stylus button.
- **Pan**:  
  Press and hold the stylus button and move the pen to drag the canvas.
- **Zoom**:  
  Use the mouse wheel to zoom in (scroll up) or out (scroll down). Zoom is clamped between 0.1 and 10.0.
- **Clear Canvas**:  
  Press `C` to clear all strokes.
- **Save / Load**:  
  `Ctrl+S` to save your current strokes to a JSON file.  
  `Ctrl+O` to load previously saved JSON data.

## Dependencies

- **Macroquad**:  
  As the graphics engine.
- **Evdev / Stylus Input**:  
  As input handling for the stylus.

## Future Improvements

- **Undo/Redo**:  
  Must have for a working app.
- **Brush Simulation**:  
  Instead of simple lines, simulate a brush or pen nib for more organic strokes.
- **Additional Tools & Settings**:  
  Add UI elements to adjust simplification, spline segments, or toggle thickness logic.
  Also to change the design of the A4 pages, or scale their Dimensions
- **Exporting to pdf**:
  There should be an option to export the canvas as a pdf.
